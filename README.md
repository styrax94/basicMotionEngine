# basicMotionEngine
A basic motion engine developed using C++ in Visual Studios. This engine can perform a variety of tasks in 2D and 3D using vector maths.

This repository includes my source code for the motion engine and a main.cpp which is my implentation of the motion engine to solve different set of problems.
